    "text": "This page serves as a reference for understanding Machine Learning Systems (ML Systems). The material consists of video lectures, slides, and additional reading material.\n\nDescription\nMachine learning models are pervasively used to solve problems in varied fields such as vision, robotics, NLP, and scientific discovery. The increased capabilities of these models has corresponded with increase in their size and compute requirements. Besides, use of these models in real-world applications demands strict requirements on performance parameters, such as latency, throughput, and hardware usage efficiency.\nThe focus of this course is on exploring these systems-related challenges during training and serving of large language models (LLMs) with special emphasis on Transformer architecture. Topics include GPU architecture and hardware-aware algorithms, ML frameworks and compilers, techniques to parallelize LLMs over multiple GPUs, and reduction of computational complexity and memory footprint.\nTextbook: The following book can be helpful for parts of the course:\nHow to Scale Your Model by Austin, J., Douglas, S., Frostig, R., Levskaya, A., Chen, C., Vikram, S., Lebron, F., Choy, P., Ramasesh, V., Webson, A., & Pope, R. (2025).\nCredits: Part of the content in the lectures is based on material from csci 1390 at Brown, created by Deepti Raghavan, cs229s at Stanford, created by Simran Arora and Azalia Mirhoseini, and cs 15-442 at CMU, by Tianqi Chen.\nDisclaimer: This being the first offering of this class, please anticipate technical difficulties. This is not an official course webpage from Plaksha University; this is maintained personally by instructor.\nFeedback: If you have found the material useful, or have suggestions on how it can be improved, I will be happy to hear from you.
